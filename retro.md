## Glad, Sad, Mad
Up to 60 minutes long discussion about the observations made during the sprint.
People write observations on post it notes (max 15min).
People give a short descprition of the cards they have written and place it on board.
Notes are divided into three columns on board(glad, sad and mad, where mad stands for external problems).
Notes are grouped by one person.
People will vote which grouped issues to discuss.
Scrum master leads the discussion of the issues in the voted order.
At this point people can agree or disagree with the observations, but the focus should be kept in making next sprint better.
When all issues have been discussed or 1h is up, it's time to finish.

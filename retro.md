## Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel

A wheel with 5 sections (Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of) is drawn, after which team members are asked to comment on the project on what has not been done, what should be continued, etc. Comments in every category are encouraged, with every comment categorized.

A variation for larger groups (>9 people) includes dividing the iteration or project into smaller subgroups like testing, customer involvement, etc. Cross-functional subgroups are encouraged, with each group creating a poster as described in 8 minutes. After that, everyone moves around the room and reads the various posters.


## Glad, Sad, Mad

Participants write brief observations regarding the previous sprint such as “Renderer optimization completed ahead of schedule” or “JIRA task descriptions are not very clear”. Each note is placed into one of the three categories, and teammembers may only ask for clarification regarding the notes. Then the participants vote on what issues do discuss further, with each person limited to voting on only so many cards. Finally the “chair” leads a discussion on how the next sprint could be improved based on the notes.

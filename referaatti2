In his article The New User Story Backlog is a Map Jeff Patton Patton describes us what's wrong with story writing. He says it is "A bag of context-free mulch". What he means with this is that the team working with the flat backlog loses the big picture with time.	Also release planning can be difficult with a flat backlog.

A different aproach would be so called story map. They step in telling the people involved a story about what they are working with.

Martin Fowler opens up in his article “Is Design dead?” the key values of of Extreme Programming(XP) and how they go along with design. XP has been criticized for the lack of planned design which can lead to a giant mess of code which can’t be developed further with any reasonable cost atleast. However XP also offers a lot of tools to avoid this from happening and comes a long with two guidelines. “You aren’t going to need it” (YAGNI) and “Do the simplest thing that could possibly work”. 

The most important tools are Testing and Continuous Integration. Tests provide a safety net when big changes are introduced in a faster pace. Continuous Integration makes sure that everyone is on the same page in the developer team and people don’t need to worry about integrating their work with other people.

Fowler points out that XP may use UML charts to design software. There may be some big decisions that have been planned ahead (like database). The point is that in XP plans and charts are only tools to make people understand the direction the project is heading. When something which was planned on day 1 and realized after becomes useless, it will most likely be refactored out in the spirit of simplifying.
